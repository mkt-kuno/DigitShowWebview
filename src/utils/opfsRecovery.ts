/**
 * Crash recovery for TSV saving — main-thread side.
 *
 * The TSV writer worker mirrors every flush into OPFS (see opfsRecoveryShared
 * for why). This module is what runs at startup: it finds mirrors that no clean
 * Stop Save ever deleted, offers them to the user, and removes them once the
 * user says the download arrived.
 *
 * Nothing here deletes a non-empty mirror on its own, and nothing deletes one
 * on the strength of having started a download: an <a download> reports neither
 * completion nor failure, so the only evidence that the data arrived is the user
 * saying so. A mirror the user does not resolve is simply offered again at the
 * next startup — the alternative, a failed or blocked download plus an automatic
 * cleanup, destroys the very data this feature exists to protect.
