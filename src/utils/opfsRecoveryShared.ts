/**
 * Naming scheme for the OPFS crash-recovery mirror, shared by the TSV writer
 * worker (which creates the mirror) and the main thread (which finds leftovers
 * at startup).
 *
 * Why a mirror exists at all: the file the user picks with showSaveFilePicker()
 * is written through a FileSystemWritableFileStream, which buffers into a swap
 * file and only swings it onto the target on close(). Until Stop Save the
 * target is 0 bytes, so a crash mid-run loses the entire run. OPFS is the one
 * place the page can write durably as it goes — createSyncAccessHandle() exists
 * on OPFS files only, is worker-only, writes without a swap file, and appends
 * without rewriting what came before.
 *
 * A clean close deletes the mirror, so anything still in the recovery directory
 * at startup is by definition a run that never finished.
 *
 * The metadata (original filename, start time) is encoded into the mirror's own
 * filename rather than kept in a sidecar file or localStorage. A crash is
 * precisely the moment two separate writes can disagree, and the one thing this
 * feature cannot afford is a recovered file whose name or timestamp belongs to
 * a different run.
