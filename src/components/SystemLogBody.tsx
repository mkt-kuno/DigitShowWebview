// The log's rows, separated from the windows that show them.
//
// It appears in three places — the System Log window, chart slot 3 on the
// launcher, and (one line of it) the footer — and they have to be the same log,
// not views that drift. Pulling the rows, the tail-follow, the threshold filter
// and the expanded set out here is what makes that true by construction.
//
// Laid out like logcat, for the reason logcat is laid out that way: one entry
// per row, fixed columns, so the eye runs down a column instead of re-parsing
// each line. Time, level, source, message — and nothing is allowed to break
// that grid, so a message with newlines in it is folded onto its single row and
// truncated. The row expands on click, which is where a traceback is read.
//
// There is a level column now, where the Script Log deliberately had none. The
// reason that argument held was that nothing writing to it carried a severity
// the writer chose — a script prints, or it fails. This log carries the app's
// own events as well, at six levels, with a threshold the reader can move; a
// row's level is now the thing that explains why it is on screen at all.
//
// No counter column, still. Numbering the rows of a log that is already in
// order and timestamped to the millisecond tells the reader where they are in a
// list they can see, while taking width from the only column with something to
// say.
//
// No Clear button either. The log scrolls on its own and the threshold is the
// control that quiets it; a button that destroys the record of the last hour to
// make the last minute easier to read is the wrong trade in a window whose
// whole job is to still have the line from an hour ago.
