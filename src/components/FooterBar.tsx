// — and the two rows then disagreed about which clock and which colour meant
// what. There is one row now, always the same height, and the app's failures
// arrive on it the same way a script's output does: as System Log lines, at
// ERROR, in red, with the subsystem as their tag.
//
// Nothing is dismissable here any more, because nothing is sticky: the line
// rolls, and the record it rolled off is in the System Log window rather than
// behind a × that threw it away.

            No breakpoint gate at all, unlike the script-name chip beside it.

            came from; this is stated nowhere else in the app, and a phone on
