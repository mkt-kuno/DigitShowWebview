// What the app reported: connection events, save failures, storage trouble,
// and whatever a script printed — one stream, one clock.
//
// This was the Script Log, five lines tall, inside the Script Runner. Five lines
// is enough to notice an error and not enough to read one — a traceback scrolled
// past inside a box that small, in the window whose whole purpose is the editor
// above it. A window of its own can be opened next to the runner, made as tall
// as the failure needs, and left open across runs.
//
// It absorbed the old app status bar with the rename. A script that stopped
// printing because the serial link had dropped used to tell that story across
// two surfaces with two clocks; there is one place to look now, and the reader
// picks how much of it to see with the level control in the header.
//
// The rows themselves live in SystemLogBody, because chart slot 3 shows the same
// log on the launcher and the two must not be able to drift apart.
