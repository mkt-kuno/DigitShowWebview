// rather than the 8192 the hardware may well allow.
//
// That headroom has since been spent from the other side: CHART_REDRAW_INTERVAL_MS

// were never separately visible — they only ever added buffer churn and, at the

// single splice with no clock read and no scan for the cutoff.
//

// One constant, not one per mode: the saving case used to be slower (500 vs
// 200 ms) on the argument that a whole-capture view moves less per sample, but

// things to reason about. Unified at 500 at the time — the slower of the two —
// and now back at 200: 2 fps made a live trace visibly step rather than move,
// which is the one thing a preview is for, and 5 fps is still half the 10 Hz
// chart input rate so no flush goes unseen.
